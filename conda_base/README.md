# Conda LMOD modulefile


This directory houses the modulefiles to setup the base environment of a conda environment (ananconda/miniforge).
The scripts are derived from the setup scripts in [this article](http://gregoryzynda.com/python/lmod/module/conda/tensorflow/2020/04/30/conda-modules.html).

These scripts set up everything for conda right before activating any given environment.
